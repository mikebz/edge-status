# edge-status
A quick project that probes other resources for status and return aggregated status that can replace status checking.

## Description
Problem:
- I'd like to create an aggregate status across many ConfigMaps that gives me an all up idea bout the system running.
- I'd like it to be across the entire cluster.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.22.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/edge-status:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified.
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment.
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands donâ€™t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Run and Debug Locally**
During development you can run the controller locally like this:
```
make run
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/edge-status:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

Getting the status of the resources can be done here:
```
kubectl get check check-sample -oyaml

apiVersion: probe.mikebz.com/v1
kind: Check
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration: |
      {"apiVersion":"probe.mikebz.com/v1","kind":"Check","metadata":{"annotations":{},"labels":{"app.kubernetes.io/managed-by":"kustomize","app.kubernetes.io/name":"edge-status"},"name":"check-sample","namespace":"default"},"spec":null}
  creationTimestamp: "2024-12-16T21:24:29Z"
  generation: 1
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: kustomize
    app.kubernetes.io/name: edge-status
  name: check-sample
  namespace: default
  resourceVersion: "1024522"
  uid: 3e3d6d9e-2d2f-49a4-a8fb-3715e0ddee15
status:
  enabled: true
  total: 3
```

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Project Distribution

Following are the steps to build the installer and distribute this project to users.

1. Build the installer for the image built and published in the registry:

```sh
make build-installer IMG=<some-registry>/edge-status:tag
```

NOTE: The makefile target mentioned above generates an 'install.yaml'
file in the dist directory. This file contains all the resources built
with Kustomize, which are necessary to install this project without
its dependencies.

2. Using the installer

Users can just run kubectl apply -f <URL for YAML BUNDLE> to install the project, i.e.:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/edge-status/<tag or branch>/dist/install.yaml
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

**NOTE:** Run `make help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
